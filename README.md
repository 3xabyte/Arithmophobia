# Arithmophobia 1.0a

A stats tracker for the game Phasmophobia.

## What does it do?

This app allows the user to enter data based on the games they have played. All the user needs to do is enter the following:

*   Ghost type
*   Map they played on
*   Did the player get the ghost correct?
*   Did the player die?

The app stores that info on a local database, where the program can then extract that information to show the user the following statistics:

*   Overall success rate
*   Overall death rate
*   Most common ghost(s)
*   Least common ghost(s)
*   Most deaths to ghost type(s)
*   Most common map(s)
*   Least common map(s)
*   Number of encounters with a ghost

## Planned Features

*   Last 100 games stats
*   Longest last seen stat
*   Map stats
*   Mobile app
*   And More!



*This is currently a Python project, it will eventually become a mobile app.*
